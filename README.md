# Value Investor
 
I'll be using a LSTM model in order to predict the daily, weekly, and monthly prices of various companies in order to give investment recommendations for the year 2021. I am hoping to be able to make investment recommendations that only turn a profit for each company to maximize the performance of a portfolio that holds these stocks. The investment recommendations and performances of each company is in their respective notebooks.

I used PyTorch to implement the LSTM model and there is a TensorFlow application of the LSTM model in the PAMP notebook. All the necessary modules and functions are located in the data_functions file.

# Conclusion

I was able to create an investment strategy that resulted in a profit for almost all of the companies. The only company that I was unable to was CCB which had been on a downtrend for the whole first quarter of 2021. The daily predictions were usually the best performing for most of the companies except for IMPJ where the weekly predictions performed best. I would recommend using the daily predictions in order to maximize the performance of a portfolio that carries these stocks.
